Our study aimed to identify main co-activation networks across the past twenty years of task-based meta-analyses. Using hierarchical clustering on (dis)similarity between findings from 1347 meta-analyses (i.e., 19,822 peak coordinates), we found 13 data-driven co-activation networks which spatially correlated to distinct psychological terms, PET receptor density maps and intrinsic connectivity networks. The 13 co-activation networks are provided (both unthresholded and thresholded/binarized). For Users interested in Meta-analytic Coactivation Modeling (MACM) analyses, a data file is also provided with the 1347 meta-analyses with their respective PMID.
